  <p>The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe</p>
  <p>Once, upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary;</p>
  <p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore –– </p>
    <p> While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
  <p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
  <p>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door –– </p>
      <p>Only this and nothing more."</p>
